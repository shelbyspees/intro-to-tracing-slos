## Abstract

> Distributed tracing is becoming more accessible with libraries like OpenTelemetry, and custom instrumentation helps us capture data that better represents the user experience.
> Shelby Spees, SRE at Equinix, shares the benefits of tracing-based SLOs and how to define SLIs for trace data using examples from Equinix Metal.

## Accessibility note

Due to limitations in the markdown slide rendering tool I used, the images in this talk lack alt-text descriptions and thus are not accessible to people using screenreaders to read either the PDF slides or the rendered markdown.
This does not meet my standards for accessibility.

After considering several workarounds, I decided it makes the most sense to convert the talk into a blog post where it'll be more straightforward to include image descriptions.
I apologize for the delay in making that content available.
